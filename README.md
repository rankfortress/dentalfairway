<h1>Brush your teeth twice a day</h1>
<p>
To have healthy teeth, you need to see a dentist regularly. Checkups can reveal problems before they become serious so that preventative treatment may be started early on. Some common areas to check during your exam are yellow or dark spots on your teeth, tooth decay or erosion of enamel and fillings, redness or swelling in your gums, and recession of bone around the teeth.

If you live in Kitchener make sure you’re coming in for regular dental exams, as well as if you are moving here (or even if you already live here), it is important to develop a relationship with a good dentist right away! At Scott Dental Associates we are proud to be a part of our local community and want to be there for anyone who needs us!
